### Why is everyone in such a rush?

Everyone is in a big rush to learn about programming, or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else.

- **Teach Yourself**: In 24 hours you won't hava time to write several significant programs, you won't hava time to learn much. So the book can only be talking about a superficial familiarity, not a deep understanding. **A little learning is a dangerous thing.**
- **Java**: In 24 hours you might be able to learn some of the syntax of Java(if you already know another language), but you couldn't learn much about how to use the language. In short, you couldn't learn what Java is actually good (and bad) for. 
- **In 24 hours**: Unfortunately, this is not enough...



### Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years

Researchers have shown it takes about 10 years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including painting, composition... **The key is deleberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analying your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts: even Mozart.**



### So You Want to be a Programmer

- **Get interested in programming**, and do some because it is fun. Make sure that it keeps being enough fun so that you will be willing to put in your ten years/10000 hours.

- **Program**. The best kind of learning is learning by doing. The most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an appropriate difficulty level for the repetition and corrections of errors.

- **Talk with** other programmers; read other programs. This is more important than any book or training course.

- If you want, put in four years at a **college(or more at a graduate school)**. This will give you access to some jobs that require credentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field. Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment cna make somebody an expert painter.

- Work on **projects with** other programmers.

- Work on **projects after** other programmers. Understand a program written by someone else. See what it takes to understand and fix it when the original programmers are not around. Think about how to design your programs to make it easier for those who will maintain them after you.

- Learn at least a half dozen **programming languages**. Include one language that emphasizes class abstractions(like Java or C++), one that emphasezes functional abstraction(like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications(like Prolog or C++ templates), and one that emphasizes parallelism(like Clojure or Go).

- Remenber that there is a "**computer**" in "computer science".

- Get involved in a language **standardization** effort.

- Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as quickly as possible.

  

### How to find great software designers?

- Systemativally identify top designers as early as possible.
- Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect and carefully keep a career file.
- Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact and stimulate each other.
